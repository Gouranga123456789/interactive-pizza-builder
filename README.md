The Interactive Pizza Builder is a single-page application built with vanilla **JavaScript, HTML, and modern CSS** to demonstrate advanced frontend development techniques. This project allows users to visually construct a custom pizza, where toppings are dynamically added or removed from the base in real-time, and a live price summary updates with every change. It showcases heavy **DOM manipulation** for the visual builder, **complex form validation** within a multi-step checkout process that includes rules like serviceable pincodes and live payment card formatting, and seamless **client-side routing** for a smooth user experience without page reloads. The interface is designed to be modern and engaging, featuring a responsive layout, subtle animations, and a "glassmorphism" effect for a premium UI.
